# The Data Bill of Rights

Our data is invaluable; it contains our thoughts, experiences, and interactions. Therefore we declare these rights:

1. We have the right to create, access, manipulate, and share our data in whatever way we choose. 
2. We have the right to choose which third parties we grant access to our data, the right to control the subset of data that a third party may access, and the right to remove access previously granted. 
3. We have the right to choose where our data is stored and the right to change that location without any consequences to the integrity or accessibility of our data. 
4. We have the right to choose which utilities we use to create, access, manipulate, and share our data and the right to change utilities without consequences to the integrity and accessibility of our data. 
5. We have the right to share our data with others regardless of either party's choice of storage location or utilities.

Any product or business model built upon violating these rights should be considered harmful.
